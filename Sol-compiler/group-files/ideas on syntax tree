This file explain the ideas behind the SOL abstract syntax tree

1) The syntax tree is EBNF like. This has been decided to reduce the size of the tree and so to increase performance. This
	means that:
	
	1) for the construction of "syntax.y" file we have used lamperti's file "bnf.pdf". 
	2) xxx-list must not be inside the abstract syntax tree: so if in the tree there is a node called (for example) stat-list THIS IS AN ERROR
	3) xxx-opt must always be constructed, even if they have no children
